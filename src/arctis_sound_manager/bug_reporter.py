    Background (INT-1 in docs/HARDWARE-QUESTIONS.md): a USB interface that
    exposes a HID collection is always transported by usbhid.ko — that is
    the generic USB-class driver for interface class 3, and it is what
    ``<interface>/driver`` points to whether the interface ends up driven by
    hid-generic, a vendor driver (hid-playstation, hid-logitech-hidpp, and
    from Linux 7.3 hid-steelseries), or nothing at all. Reading that symlink
    therefore never distinguishes anything ASM would want to tell a user
    apart — it always says "usbhid".

    The decision that matters happens one layer up, on the *hid* bus: usbhid
    creates a child device inside the interface's own sysfs directory (id
    format "<bus>:<vid>:<pid>.<instance>", e.g. "0003:1038:12E0.0005"), and
    *that* device's ``driver`` symlink names hid-generic / hid-steelseries /
    whichever vendor driver actually claimed it. This walks down to that
    child and reads its driver, falling back to the interface's own driver
    (or None) when no such child exists yet — e.g. mid-boot-race, or a non-
    HID interface such as the Nova-family audio-class interfaces.

    Pure filesystem read: needs no USB permissions ASM might not have, which
    is what makes it useful from exactly the failure paths (EACCES on

    permission every time" and "headset reads as not connected", with nothing

    Nothing here needs access to the device:

      * the rules file's own mode: it was once installed 0600 by a `pkexec cp`
        and udev silently ignored it, so the dialog came back at every login;
      * every SteelSeries device the kernel enumerated, straight from sysfs,
        so a headset that pyusb cannot open is still listed with its PID;
      * the /dev/bus/usb node's owner, mode and ACL. `TAG+="uaccess"` grants
        access by adding an ACL entry for the logged-in user, so `user:1000:rw-`
