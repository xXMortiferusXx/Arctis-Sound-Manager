"""Screen + multi-track audio capture feeding a rolling clip buffer.

The GStreamer/portal half of the clip feature. It keeps a live capture running
and hands encoded frames to :mod:`clip_buffer`, so that "save the last N
seconds" is answered from memory rather than by starting a recording after the
fact — the moment worth clipping has always already happened.

GStreamer and PyGObject are an optional dependency: ASM works exactly as before
without them, and only the clip feature is unavailable. Nothing here is
imported at ASM start-up for that reason.

Four things about this pipeline were established by measurement on real
hardware, and each of them fails in a way that points somewhere else:

* **The portal session must last as long as the capture.** It is bound to the
  D-Bus client that created it; drop that and the node id stays valid-looking
  while its stream is dead. pipewiresrc then reports "target not found". It
  must also be closed once the capture is over — see ScreenCastPortal.close().
  Releasing the reference is not closing it, and the compositor draws a
  recording indicator for every session still open.
* **Downstream caps must be concrete.** With an ANY-caps sink, pipewiresrc has
  no format to offer, connects with "no format given", and the core rejects it
  as — again — "target not found", a message about the target for what is
  really an empty format list.
* **Never connect without a target.** With autoconnect and no path,
  pipewiresrc binds whatever source it finds first; on a machine with a
  capture card that means silently recording the webcam instead of the game.
* **The frame never needs to leave the GPU.** nvh264enc accepts GLMemory
  directly, so glupload → glcolorconvert → encoder avoids a full-resolution
  copy per frame.

    fixed in the one remux this already ran for the default flag — a stream
    copy, ~50 ms on a 30 s clip, so naming the tracks costs nothing on top.

    **The names.** matroskamux takes titles from stream tags, which appsrc does
    not carry, so every track was written as a bare "Audio". ASM itself was fine
    — it writes the channel names into a sidecar and reads them back — but the
    clip was only self-describing inside ASM. Opened in mpv or VLC, or handed to
    anyone else, a five-channel clip offered five tracks called Audio, and
    finding the microphone meant playing each one. The sidecar stays: it also
    carries the game and the duration, and it survives a player that drops
    unknown tags on a re-encode.

    **The default flag.** Matroska's FlagDefault is 1 when it is not written,
    and matroskamux never writes it — so a clip carrying five channels tells
    every player that all five are the default. The player then picks by its own
    tie-break, and since most channels in a normal session are empty (nothing is
    routed to Chat, the microphone is muted), what it usually picks is silence.
    The clip looks like it recorded no audio when two of its tracks are
    perfectly loud, which is exactly the report this fixes.

    Which track to keep is decided by how many encoded bytes it holds. Opus
    compresses silence to almost nothing — in the reported clip the three empty
    channels came to ~15 kB each while the two real ones were 30 kB and 151 kB
    — so the answer is already sitting in the buffer and costs nothing. It
    beats picking the first channel, which is the Game channel and is empty for
    anyone playing through the headset directly.

    Any failure leaves the original file exactly as it was — a clip with
    unnamed tracks and an awkward default flag is worth far more than no clip.

    who picked their OBS window and read "Recording: Google Chrome" has been
    told the capture is pointed somewhere it is not.

    Wayland forbids enumerating other apps' windows, so the screen cannot say
    what is on it. The audio graph can, and ASM already watches it.

    The first question asked is the one only this app can answer: *which stream

    themselves (or that video_router made for them), and it beats every
    heuristic — no list to maintain, and it is right by construction. It is also

    name-based detection picked whichever stream came first and wrote
    "WEBRTC_VoiceEngine" onto a Genshin clip.

    Identification is then positive first and negative second. A blocklist alone
    ("anything that is not a browser is a game") only works for titles someone

    is taken as the game outright, whatever it is called. Only when nothing

    The ceiling is `max-framerate`, not `framerate`, and that distinction is the
    whole fix. The portal negotiates `framerate=0/1` — a variable-rate stream,
    which is what a screen is, since it sends a frame only when something
    changes. In that mode videorate has no cadence to measure against and
    `max-rate` alone drops nothing at all: asked for 15 fps the capture kept 59,
    and clips came out at roughly twice the size the setting implied.
    `max-framerate` is the field a variable-rate stream carries its ceiling in,
    and constraining it here propagates back up — far enough that the portal
    itself starts producing at the lower rate, so the frames are never made
    rather than made and dropped.

    Pinning `framerate` instead would force an exact cadence onto a stream that
    does not have one, which is what used to hold frames long enough to look
    frozen.

    Two chains when GL is in play, tried in order: glupload keeps the frame on
    the GPU, which is worth a great deal at 1440p, but it cannot always import
