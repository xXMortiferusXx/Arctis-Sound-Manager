sonar_to_pipewire.py — Generate PipeWire filter-chain configs for Sonar EQ channels.

One config per channel (game / chat / micro).  Each config inserts a chain of
biquad nodes between the virtual capture sink and its playback target.

Routing (targets resolved at generation time from the currently-attached device):
  game  → effect_input.virtual-surround-7.1-hesuvi        (8ch 7.1 → HeSuVi)
  media → effect_input.virtual-surround-7.1-hesuvi-media  (8ch 7.1 → HeSuVi, #169)
  chat  → physical ALSA output of the current Arctis      (2ch stereo)
  micro → virtual source backed by the physical mic       (1ch mono)

Game and Media each own a SEPARATE HeSuVi chain (issue #169) so their
Immersion/Distance are independent; both surround chains drive the same
physical GAME output. Game keeps the historical un-suffixed names.

All configs are written to filter-chain.conf.d/ and loaded by the filter-chain service.
Restarting only filter-chain (not pipewire) preserves active audio streams.

Config generators return an empty string without writing anything when no
Arctis device is currently attached (`device_state.is_device_set()` == False).

# ── Link-permission fallback (issue #203) ───────────────────────────────────
# The channel EQ nodes are declared Audio/Sink/Internal so they stay out of
# every output picker: they are ASM's plumbing, not somewhere a user picks.
# Only the Output channel is a real Audio/Sink, because a routing pin has to be
# able to name it.
#
# On a session that starts ASM's clients restricted — SteamOS through Distrobox
# is the reported case (issue #203, same family as #181) — PipeWire refuses the
# cross-client link from pw-loopback into an Internal node, while the identical
# link into an Audio/Sink node succeeds. Measured on a normal Arch/KDE session,
# the Internal link works, so this is a property of the session's permissions
# and not of the class: flipping every install to Audio/Sink would put three
# plumbing nodes in everyone's output picker to fix a case most people do not
# have.
#
# So the class stays Internal, and a channel is degraded to Audio/Sink only
# after PipeWire has actually refused its link on permissions, repeatedly. The
# decision is remembered here so the next conf regeneration keeps it.

    for the first LADSPA .so matching *name_pattern*, or ``None`` if no plugin
    was found (adapted from PR #104's ``_resolve_ladspa_plugin``).

    *resolved* lets a caller pass an already-chosen absolute path (e.g. the
    version-aware DeepFilterNet pick) and still get the same container staging;
    when omitted the path is resolved by first glob match as before.

    Single source of truth for the search itself (LADSPA_PATH + ~/.ladspa +
    system dirs) lives in ``system_deps_checker._find_ladspa_plugin``, which
    already returns an absolute path — reused here.

    NOTE: under Distrobox/Flatpak the filter-chain service runs on the HOST
    while this scan sees the CONTAINER filesystem. A plugin found here may be
    absent on the host, making filter-chain SEGV when it tries to dlopen() it
    (issue #88). Writing the CONTAINER's absolute path into the config would
    make that worse (the host has no reason to have that exact path), so:

    - native (no container) → absolute path is safe, use it. This fixes
      LADSPA_PATH lookups failing inside a systemd user unit that doesn't
      inherit the shell's environment (e.g. Fedora's /usr/lib64/ladspa/).
    - container + path under ``~/.ladspa`` → HOME is bind-mounted into the
      container, so the host sees the same file at the same path — absolute
      path stays safe.
    - container + system-wide path (e.g. /usr/lib64/ladspa/…) → the host may
      not have that plugin at all (Bazzite/Fedora Atomic ships no swh-plugins,
      so plate_1423/sc4m/gate fail to dlopen on the HOST and take the whole
      filter-chain module — HeSuVi included — down with them, issue #100).
      A bare plugin name only worked when the host happened to have the plugin;
      it silently killed Spatial Audio when it didn't. Instead we STAGE the
      plugin into ``~/.ladspa`` (bind-mounted, same x86_64/glibc ABI) and hand
      the host an absolute path it can always load. Falls back to the bare name
      only if the copy fails, so we are never worse than before.

# ── Generated-config versioning ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every filter-chain .conf this module writes carries an
# "# ASM-CONF-VERSION: <n>" line in its header, right under the standard
# "Auto-generated by Arctis Sound Manager" comment. check_and_fix_stale_configs()
# compares that marker against _CONF_VERSION and regenerates any file whose
# marker is missing or lower, so an upgrade that changes what a conf *contains*
# actually reaches users who already have an older conf sitting on disk.
#
# Bump _CONF_VERSION whenever a change alters the *shape* of a generated
# conf — a node added/removed/reordered/retyped, a link changed, a new
# processing stage inserted, playback/capture props gaining or losing a
# field, etc. Do NOT bump it for changes that only alter the *values* written
# into an already-existing node (Freq/Q/Gain literals, a target string, a
# comment) — those are picked up the next time the conf is regenerated for
# any other reason and don't need every existing user's conf force-rewritten.
#
# Scope — read before extending this:
# The marker is written into EVERY generated conf, but an outdated marker is
# only a *regeneration trigger* for the HeSuVi surround conf. That one is
# rebuilt losslessly from sonar_spatial_audio.json, so regenerating it costs
# the user nothing. The Sonar EQ and micro confs are different: their repair
# path in check_and_fix_stale_configs()/ensure_sonar_eq_configs() now prefers
# a lossless rebuild too (CHA-7) — from the last-applied state this module
# snapshots itself (_save_eq_state/_load_eq_state for game/chat/media/output,
# _save_micro_state/_load_micro_state for micro, both written the moment a
# conf is actually generated, not by the GUI) — but it can still fall back to
# a flat *bypass* conf when no such snapshot exists yet, e.g. a channel that
# was never Applied. A version bump alone is not a reason to force that risk
# on every existing conf on every upgrade, so it stays out of the trigger set
# for these confs even now that the common case rebuilds losslessly.
#
# History:
#   1 — baseline. Introduced after v1.2.5 added a LADSPA limiter node to the
#       HeSuVi surround chain (generate_hesuvi_conf) but users upgrading from
#       1.2.4 kept their pre-limiter conf forever: none of the existing
#       staleness checks in check_and_fix_stale_configs() ever matched it, so
#       the fix was silently inert for every existing install. This mechanism
#       exists so that class of bug can't recur.
#   2 — issue #169: the Media channel gained its OWN HeSuVi chain
#       (sink-virtual-surround-7.1-hesuvi-media.conf) so Game and Media carry
#       independent Immersion/Distance. Bumping forces the daemon to rebuild
#       the (still un-suffixed) Game conf once so both chains are regenerated
#       from their per-channel JSON — lossless, sourced from sonar_spatial_audio*.json.
#   3 — the EQ and micro confs now emit a fixed rack of band slots (see
#       _band_slot_rack) instead of one node per active band, so adding,
#       deleting or disabling a band is a control change rather than a new
#       graph. Node count and order changed → a shape change by the rule
#       above. Note this does not force those confs to be rewritten (see the
#       Scope note): they are regenerated by the GUI on the next EQ edit,
#       which pays the last restart the old shape will ever cost.
#   4 — issue #180: every playback.props of an output chain gained
#       node.passive, so the chain (and the headset it feeds) can suspend when
#       nothing is playing. A props field added → a shape change by the rule
#       above. This one needs more than the marker, though: the marker only
#       triggers regeneration for the HeSuVi conf, and the EQ confs cannot be
#       regenerated without flattening the user's bands. A single non-passive
#       node anywhere in the chain keeps the headset awake, so an EQ conf left
#       untouched would make the whole fix inert — exactly the failure mode
#       this mechanism exists to prevent. _ensure_passive_playback() therefore
#       repairs those in place, inserting the one missing line and touching
#       nothing else.

# ── Band slot rack ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Phase 4 (issue #100/#88): a channel's bands are not emitted one node per
# band. They are laid into a rack of a fixed number of slots — the enabled
# bands first, then unity passthroughs filling what is left. Adding a band,
# deleting one or toggling one off therefore only rewrites Freq/Q/Gain
# literals: the node count, order and labels stay exactly where they were, so
# diff_filter_conf() can report the change and _ApplyWorker pushes it into the
# running graph with pw-cli set-param instead of restarting filter-chain —
# which tears every EQ node down and takes the audio with it for a few
# seconds. That restart is what users heard as "the sound cuts out when I hit
# Apply". Same trick Phase 1 used to pin the macro and boost nodes into the
# graph, applied to the bands themselves.
#
# The rack has to be bigger than the curves that go in it, or it buys
# nothing. Sonar's parametric EQ *is* a ten-filter rack and every preset on
# disk carries exactly filter1..filter10 — so a rack of ten is full the moment
# a preset uses all its filters (plenty do: Music - Punchy, Flat), and the
# first band the user adds on top overflows it and takes the restart the rack
# exists to avoid. Sixteen leaves six free slots under the worst preset, which
# is more bands than a curve drawn by hand tends to grow by.
#
# Past that the rack grows a step at a time rather than band by band, so
# crossing the line costs one restart and then buys another eight edits.

# The rack is laid out by filter type, not in the order the bands happen to

# coming out is the same either way — but a fixed layout means deleting a band
# only ever empties a slot of its own type, instead of sliding the band below
# it into a slot holding a different filter. That is a relabelled node, and a
# relabelled node is a restart: without this, one shelf anywhere in a preset
# made *every* delete on that channel restart, and the stock Flat preset has
# one at each end.
#
# Only these three are pre-allocated: Gain=0.0 makes each of them a true unity
# passthrough, so an unused slot costs nothing but the arithmetic. A high- or
# low-pass filters at any gain and cannot be parked as unity, so those are
# emitted only while in use — adding or removing one stays structural.

    1. ``sc.is_active("filter-chain")`` — if False, the service may simply not
       have started yet (a boot-ordering race, or it was disabled). Instead of
       treating that alone as a crash-loop, call ``sc.start("filter-chain")``

       stays down (or crashes again), that *is* a crash-loop — enter safe mode
       exactly as before. This avoids disabling the EQ on a merely-not-yet-
       started service while still catching a genuine crash-loop.
    2. ``NRestarts`` (systemd only) — if >= 3 the service has restarted at
       least 3 times, which strongly indicates a crash-loop.
    2b. On dinit (where ``NRestarts`` has no equivalent, SD-2), a
        ``_dinit_crash_loop_settled()`` fallback watches the service live for
        up to 12 s and treats it settling into STOPPED as dinit's own
        restart-limit having been hit — see that function's docstring for why
        this is init-appropriate rather than an invented output format.

    If unhealthy → calls ``_enter_filter_chain_safe_mode()`` which moves ASM
    configs aside and restarts filter-chain without them so audio is flat but
    stable rather than permanently cut.

    Returns True when the filter-chain appears healthy (or there is nothing

    Build and optionally write a filter-chain .conf for the microphone EQ.

    Creates a virtual Audio/Source node backed by the physical mic input.
    Pattern: capture side is passive (faces hardware), playback side has
    media.class = Audio/Source (faces applications).

    Issue #127: the capture side runs with ``node.autoconnect = false`` and
    ``state.restore-target = false`` — the same "ASM owns this link" pattern
    already applied to the loopback/EQ output links (issue #100), but on the
    *input* side this time. Without it, every filter-chain restart triggered
    by a micro EQ edit recreates ``effect_input.sonar-micro-eq`` and
    WirePlumber does not reliably honor ``target.object``: it can link the
    capture to whatever it considers the current default/restored source
    (another connected mic) instead of the Arctis. ``target.object`` is kept
    as a documentary hint only; :func:`ensure_micro_capture_link` is what
    actually (re)establishes and enforces the link.

    The playback side gets the same treatment (``node.autoconnect = false``
    and ``state.restore-target = false``): the output is an Audio/Source that
    must only ever be *captured* by applications, never *routed* to an output
    sink. A stale WirePlumber ``target`` persisted for
    ``effect_output.sonar-micro-eq`` re-applies on every (re)connect and hands
    the mic straight to the physical output — audible as the user hearing
    themselves on one side despite sidetone being off.

    Both directories are read, by different processes: ``filter-chain.conf.d/``
    by ``filter-chain.service``, ``pipewire.conf.d/`` by the pipewire daemon
    itself. The same filter declared in both loads twice, and two nodes then
    answer to one ``node.name`` — at which point every route ASM sets by name
    (``target.object = effect_input.sonar-media-eq``) is ambiguous. The loopback
    that cannot resolve it links to nothing and, with
    ``node.dont-fallback = true``, nothing falls back either: the channel's
    meters move while the headset stays silent.

    That was issue #14 (a static HeSuVi conf left in ``pipewire.conf.d/`` by an
    old install.sh) and it came back as #205 with the whole EQ chain doubled.
    The reason it came back is that the repair was a hand-written list of four
    filenames: ``sonar-output-eq.conf`` and the ``-media`` HeSuVi variant were
    added to the generator later and nobody added them here. So this derives the
    set instead of listing it, and stays correct for filters not written yet.

    Two ways a file earns removal:

    - **A name we generate.** Same filename in ``filter-chain.conf.d/`` means a
      copy of ours, wherever it came from. This is what catches #14: the static
      HeSuVi template carries no ASM header at all (it opens with "# Convolver
      sink"), so a marker check alone would walk straight past the original bug.
    - **Our marker.** ``# Auto-generated by Arctis Sound Manager`` identifies a
      leftover of ours even with no counterpart left to compare against.

    Anything else is left alone and only reported. A conf in there that is not
    ours is the user's, and a duplicate node is not a good enough reason to
    delete someone's file — #205's reporter had a spatializer of his own in that
    directory and was surprised to learn it was not part of ASM.

def check_and_fix_stale_configs() -> tuple[bool, bool]:
    """Detect and fix stale Sonar configs.

    Checks for:
    1. Any filter conf in ``pipewire.conf.d/`` duplicating one of ours (see
       :func:`_purge_duplicate_pipewire_confs`): the daemon loads that directory
       on top of what filter-chain.service loads, two nodes answer to one name,
       and the channel routed by that name goes silent (#14, then #205).
    2. Configs using the broken ``label = gain`` builtin (PipeWire 1.6.x).
    3. (folded into 1 — it used to be a separate hand-listed set of filenames,
       which is exactly how ``sonar-output-eq.conf`` and the ``-media`` HeSuVi
       variant were missed until #205.)
    4. 2ch game EQ when spatial audio is ON (must be 8ch for HeSuVi).
    5. Virtual sink targets out of sync with current EQ mode.
    6. HeSuVi config with stale ``node.target`` (wrong physical output).
    7. Micro config with empty ``target.object`` written before device attach —
       PipeWire would otherwise bind to the first available source (e.g. a game
       controller mic) instead of the Arctis headset.
    8. HeSuVi config whose ``# ASM-CONF-VERSION`` marker is missing or older
       than ``_CONF_VERSION`` (see :func:`_conf_is_outdated`) — i.e. the file
       predates a change to the *shape* of what this module generates. This is
       what makes a fix like v1.2.5's HeSuVi output limiter actually reach
       users who already had a ``sink-virtual-surround-7.1-hesuvi.conf`` on
       disk from an older release: without it, none of checks 1-7 above ever
       matched that file and it was silently never regenerated across the
       upgrade. Deliberately limited to the HeSuVi conf — see the "Scope" note
       on ``_CONF_VERSION`` for why the EQ/micro confs are excluded.
    9. Micro config missing entirely. ``ensure_sonar_eq_configs()`` guarantees
       game/media/chat/output but not micro, and no package or install script
       ships it, so on an install where the user never pressed "Apply" in the
       micro EQ tab ``effect_output.sonar-micro-eq`` simply never existed —
       yet the daemon makes it the default source at startup. This is the
       only guarantor that file has, and it runs whatever ``.eq_mode`` says.
       Repaired via :func:`_regenerate_micro_conf`, which — like
       :func:`_regenerate_eq_conf` for the other four channels (CHA-7) —
       prefers rebuilding from the last saved micro state (bands, macros,
       boost, noise cancelling and the four noise-reduction sub-processors)
       and only falls back to a flat bypass when nothing was ever saved.
    Check 10 (issue #180: repairing confs missing ``node.passive``) was
    removed — node.passive is no longer written anywhere. See memory
    project_asm_passive_suspend_saga for why: it made every channel's audio
    depend on another channel actively playing to keep the shared downstream
    chain awake, which was the root cause behind #223 and a major
    contributor to #230. #180 (headset auto-off while ASM runs) is reopened
    as the accepted trade-off.

    Returns ``(fixed, needs_pipewire_restart)``.  *fixed* is True if any config
    was regenerated or cleaned.  *needs_pipewire_restart* is True when anything
    was removed from ``pipewire.conf.d/``; the caller must restart the main
    PipeWire process, because the daemon loaded those modules at startup and
    deleting the file does not unload the duplicate node it created.

) -> dict[str, bool]:
    """Move each EQ's live output link to match its Spatial Audio toggle.

    ``effect_output.sonar-<channel>-eq`` (game/media only) runs with
    ``node.autoconnect=false`` — exactly the same "ASM owns this link"
    pattern ``pw_utils.ensure_loopback_link`` already uses for the
    loopback→EQ links (issue #100). WirePlumber therefore never links or
    moves this node; toggling Spatial Audio is nothing more than moving that
    one link between the HeSuVi virtual-surround sink (ON) and the physical
    output (OFF) — a plain ``pw-link`` operation, with **no** filter-chain
    restart. This is what sidesteps the SIGTERM-during-DSP race that SEGVs
    filter-chain on PipeWire 1.6.7 (#100/#88): the service itself is never
    touched by a Spatial Audio toggle once its EQ node is up.

    The EQ node stays 8ch and its playback.props always carries the HeSuVi
    node name as a static (but inert, since autoconnect is off) hint — see
    :func:`generate_sonar_eq_conf`'s docstring — so calling this after any
    conf regeneration, restart, or plain watchdog tick is always safe and
    idempotent: it either confirms the existing link is already correct or
    moves it, and never restarts anything itself.

    Feasibility note (Phase 3 hardware validation, issue #100/#88): the OFF
    path links an **8ch** EQ output to the **2ch** physical output. This is
    done with ``ensure_loopback_link``, which creates explicit *channel-matched
    pw-link* connections (FL→FL, FR→FR) — it does NOT route through an
    adapter that channel-mixes 8→2. That distinction is what keeps OFF-mode
    stereo bit-clean and avoids any regression versus the old 2ch-EQ OFF path:
    PipeWire's 2→8 upmix (which fills the EQ's 8 channels from the 2ch
    loopback) never alters the passthrough front channels — FL/FR always carry
    the original L/R at unity — and any synthesised centre/surround content it
    adds to FC/LFE/RL/RR/SL/SR is simply *dropped* here (those source channels
    have no matching port on the 2ch target), rather than folded back in by a
    downmix matrix. So the round-trip in OFF is loopback-2ch → EQ-FL/FR →
    physical-FL/FR, i.e. clean stereo. (An adapter 8→2 downmix of the
    psd-upmixed signal WOULD colour the sound — center/surround re-summed —
    which is exactly why we link channel-matched, not through a downmixer.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    channels:
        Which EQ channels to (re)link. Only ``"game"``/``"media"`` are
        meaningful — anything else is silently ignored.
    data:
        Optional pre-fetched ``pw-dump`` payload, so a caller that already
        fetched one this tick (e.g. the daemon's loopback watchdog) does not
        pay for a second ``pw-dump`` subprocess.
    skip_targets:
        Node names to leave alone rather than link into (#180): when Spatial
        is off a channel targets the physical output directly, and during a
        voluntary idle cutdown (:func:`~arctis_sound_manager.pw_utils.
        unlink_last_hop_into`) re-linking it here would immediately undo that
        cut. A channel whose resolved target is in this set is simply
        excluded from the result — not reported as failed — the same way an
        unknown target already is, so the watchdog's fail-tick counter never
        escalates over a link ASM removed on purpose.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[str, bool]
        ``{channel: linked}``. ``False`` most commonly means the EQ node or
        its target is not yet up (filter-chain starting/restarting, or no
        device attached) — treat as "retry later", not an error.

    Issue observed twice on hardware: the headset powers off and back on, the
    kernel/ALSA/PipeWire destroy and recreate the physical output node under a
    NEW node id, and the two nodes that carry sound the rest of the way to the
    speakers — :data:`_CHAT_OUTPUT_NAME` and :data:`_HESUVI_OUTPUT_NAME` —
    stay linked to nothing. Both nodes hard-code a ``node.target``/
    ``target.object`` hint at the physical output when their filter-chain
    config is written (see :func:`generate_sonar_eq_conf`'s chat path and
    :func:`generate_hesuvi_conf`), but that hint is only ever acted on by
    WirePlumber once, at node-creation time — it does not get re-applied when
    the *destination* node is later destroyed and recreated with a new id.
    Nothing else in the watchdog was watching this last hop:
    :func:`ensure_loopback_link` (via the loopback watchdog pass) only covers
    loopback→EQ, and :func:`ensure_spatial_eq_links` only covers game/media
    EQ→{HeSuVi,physical}. This closes that gap, exactly the same "ASM owns
    this link" pattern (issue #100) applied to the final hop:

    - ``effect_output.sonar-chat-eq`` → the physical CHAT output (mono PCM
      on dual-PCM devices, :func:`_get_physical_out_chat`).
    - ``effect_output.virtual-surround-7.1-hesuvi`` → the physical GAME
      output (stereo PCM, :func:`_get_physical_out_game`). This is the
      unconditional HeSuVi→physical hop; it does NOT touch the game/media
      EQ→{HeSuVi,physical} link that :func:`ensure_spatial_eq_links` already
      owns, so the two compose without either duplicating the other's work.
    - ``effect_output.sonar-output-eq`` → the configured EXTERNAL sink
      (HDMI/TV/speakers, :func:`_get_configured_external_output`). This hop
      had no owner whatsoever until it was added here.

    Thin wrapper around :func:`~arctis_sound_manager.pw_utils.ensure_loopback_link`
    — same idempotent semantics (no-op when already correct, stray links torn
    down, channel-name matching with the AUX0/AUX1 positional fallback for
    pro-audio devices from issue #129) applied to this last hop instead of the
    loopback→EQ or EQ→HeSuVi hops it already covers.

    When a physical target is unknown (headset off — ``device_state`` empty)
    the corresponding channel is skipped entirely: not attempted, not logged.
    It self-heals on the tick after the headset reappears, once
    ``device_state`` is populated again and the physical node re-enters the
    graph.

    data:
        Optional pre-fetched ``pw-dump`` payload, so a caller that already

        purpose, re-linking it back here on the very next tick would undo it.

        this set is simply excluded from the result, not reported as failed

    Issue #127: ``effect_input.sonar-micro-eq`` runs with
    ``node.autoconnect = false`` / ``state.restore-target = false`` (see
    :func:`generate_sonar_micro_conf`'s docstring), so WirePlumber never
    links or moves it — ASM must own this link, exactly like
    :func:`ensure_spatial_eq_links` already does for the EQ output side.
    Every micro EQ apply (config regen + filter-chain restart) recreates the
    capture node with nothing linked into it, and the watchdog calls this on
    every tick so a link stolen by a competing mic between applies is caught
    and repaired automatically.

    Issue #131: this used to unconditionally force the Arctis microphone,
    which fought any manual qpwgraph routing to a different mic. The source
    is now driven by the ``micro_input_source`` general setting:

    - ``"__auto__"`` (default, or unset/empty) — Arctis microphone, exactly
      the #127 behaviour, via :func:`_get_physical_in`.
    - ``"__manual__"`` — enforcement is skipped entirely (no link created,
      no stray link torn down), so a manual routing sticks.
    - anything else — treated as the ``node.name`` of the source to pin the
      capture to. If that source isn't in the graph yet, ``ensure_capture_link``
      returns False and the watchdog retries on the next tick.

    Thin wrapper around :func:`~arctis_sound_manager.pw_utils.ensure_capture_link`
    that resolves the configured mic input; see that function's docstring for
    why the stray-link teardown is scoped to the capture node's input side
    rather than the source's output side (the physical mic may legitimately
    feed other consumers — a recorder, OBS, …).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data:
        Optional pre-fetched ``pw-dump`` payload, so a caller that already
        fetched one this tick (e.g. the daemon's loopback watchdog) does not
        pay for a second ``pw-dump`` subprocess.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True when linked. False when in manual mode, no device is attached
        yet (nothing to link to — retry later), or the capture/source node
        is not yet in the graph (filter-chain starting/restarting).

        8 channels *before* the HRTF convolution via bq_highshelf nodes.
    distance_pct:

    output_path:
        Where to write the config.  Defaults to
        ``_CONF_DIR / _hesuvi_conf_name(channel)``.
    channel:
        ``"game"`` (default) writes the historical, un-suffixed chain
        (``effect_input/output.virtual-surround-7.1-hesuvi``,
        ``sink-virtual-surround-7.1-hesuvi.conf``) so an existing Game chain is
        byte-identical. ``"media"`` writes a parallel ``…-hesuvi-media`` chain
        so the two channels carry independent Immersion/Distance (issue #169).
        Both chains target the same physical GAME output.

    Volume Boost (issue #237): read internally via :func:`_hesuvi_boost_db`
