loopback_manager.py — Dynamic PipeWire loopback management for Arctis virtual sinks.

Each Arctis virtual sink (Game / Chat / Media) is implemented as a ``pw-loopback``
process managed by this module.  Creating loopbacks dynamically (rather than via
static ``pipewire.conf.d`` snippets) allows them to be torn down and re-created at
any time without restarting the main PipeWire daemon — which would kill Discord and
other applications that hold a PulseAudio/PipeWire sink reference.

Routing overview (unchanged from static config):
    App → Arctis_<Ch> (capture / Audio/Sink) → [loopback] → Arctis_<Ch>_sink_out
         → effect_input.sonar-<ch>-eq (filter-chain) → ... → physical output

In Sonar mode the Game/Media/Aux captures advertise 8ch 7.1
(``audio.channels=8 audio.position=[FL FR FC LFE RL RR SL SR]``) so a game
outputting real multichannel hands all eight channels through to the 8ch EQ →
HeSuVi chain instead of being collapsed to stereo at the sink — previously a
2ch capture made HRIR/Spatial Audio receive only ``FL FR`` (the extra HeSuVi
channels stayed silent), and the EQ/HeSuVi confs were already 8ch.  Chat stays
2ch ``[FL FR]`` and feeds the mono chat PCM path.  In simple mode (targets are
physical Stereo/Mono ALSA outputs) everything stays 2ch ``[FL FR]`` as before.
``stream.dont-remix=false`` on the playback side still lets PipeWire expand
2→8ch — e.g. a stereo source routed to an 8ch channel — when a link requires it.

This module is intentionally pure: no device_state access, no file I/O, no import-
time side effects.  Callers (e.g. core.py) are responsible for resolving targets and
channel names before constructing LoopbackSpec objects.

    The capture side is the Audio/Sink applications see and route to — its
    channel count decides what a game sends. Game/Media/Aux use 8ch 7.1 in
    Sonar mode (see ``LoopbackSpec.capture_channels``) so games with native
    7.1 output deliver all eight channels into the 8ch EQ → HeSuVi chain
    instead of being collapsed to stereo at the sink; Chat stays 2ch and
    feeds the mono chat PCM path. The playback side carries the same format,
    ``target.object`` (WirePlumber >= 0.5) plus ``node.target`` (0.4.x compat),
    ``stream.dont-remix=false`` (which lets PipeWire expand
    2→8ch when linking to an 8ch EQ node), and the standard linger/fallback
    flags used throughout this project.

    The props string format is the ``key=value`` space-separated form accepted
    by ``pw-loopback --capture-props`` / ``--playback-props``.

    Example for the Media channel (Sonar mode, 8ch)::

        pw-loopback
          --capture-props='node.name=Arctis_Media media.class=Audio/Sink
                           audio.channels=8
                           audio.position=[FL FR FC LFE RL RR SL SR]'
          --playback-props='node.name=Arctis_Media_sink_out
                            node.description=Media
                            audio.channels=8
                            audio.position=[FL FR FC LFE RL RR SL SR]

                            node.linger=true latency.msec=50'

# pw-loopback is started with node.linger=true (see _build_pw_loopback_argv)
# so that its PipeWire node survives brief hiccups. That flag has a side
# effect: the *process* also survives its parent. If the ASM daemon dies
# without going through LoopbackManager.stop_all() — crash, `systemctl
# restart`, kill -9 — its pw-loopback children are simply orphaned (reparented
# by the kernel), not terminated. The next daemon starts with an empty
# LoopbackManager._handles and has no way to know they exist, so it launches
# three brand new pw-loopback processes with the exact same node.name as the
# survivors. PipeWire happily accepts the duplicates, and the user ends up
# with Arctis_Game/Chat/Media doubled in their mixer — half of them dead ends
# that audio can silently vanish into.
#
# The fix is a sweep, run right before every launch, that finds and kills any
# pw-loopback process already claiming the node.name we are about to (re)use.
