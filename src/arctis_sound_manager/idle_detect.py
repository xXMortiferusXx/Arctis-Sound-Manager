"""Decide whether the whole ASM audio graph is idle (#180/#223/#230 class).

Background: the headset's own hardware auto-off timer (``auto_off_time_minutes``)
never fires while ASM runs, because ASM's loopbacks keep a PCM stream open on the
headset continuously (node.passive was removed everywhere in v1.4.21 — see #223,
#230 — so nothing suspends on its own any more). Restoring auto-off requires ASM
to notice inactivity itself and act on it explicitly, rather than delegating that
decision to PipeWire/WirePlumber suspend heuristics the way ``node.passive`` did.

This module holds the pure decision logic only (no I/O, no subprocesses, no
mutation) so it can be tested against recorded ``pw-dump`` output, on the same
pattern as :mod:`stream_guard`. As of this writing nothing calls the action side
yet — :class:`IdleTracker` only classifies "cut"/"restore" transitions; wiring an
actual link cutdown to them is a later step, gated behind real-usage observation
first (a bad idle detector here would silence audio, not just miss a link).

Deliberately NOT built on :func:`~arctis_sound_manager.pw_utils.get_native_streams`:
that helper filters out ``client.api == "pipewire-pulse"``, which excludes Discord
and most browsers. Treating those as "absent" is exactly the #223-class mistake —
a channel going silent while something the detector could not see was still using
it — so :func:`active_channels` reimplements the presence check straight off
``pw-dump``, counting every client stream regardless of API.

Verified live on 2026-09-06 against the real graph: each ``Arctis_*`` sink's own
PipeWire-generated companion stream (``Arctis_Game_sink_out`` and siblings, which
feed the EQ input) reports ``media.class == "Stream/Output/Audio"`` and sits in
state ``"running"`` permanently now that nothing is passive (v1.4.21) — with no
filter, every channel looked active 100% of the time, always. These carry
``node.virtual: true``; a real client stream (checked against a live ``paplay``)
never does. :func:`active_channels` excludes them on that property.
