# dnf cannot serve: they click "Update now", the upgrade command reports

#
# Exception — pacman: the signed Arch repository is the GitHub pacman-repo
# asset, so a newer GitHub tag is always installable via ``pacman -Syu``
# (which refreshes the sync db on upgrade). The only lag is the local sync
# database, which can sit hours behind the asset. For pacman installs the
