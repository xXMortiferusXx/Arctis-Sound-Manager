# asyncio thread pool. CPython's subprocess only takes the posix_spawn (vfork)
# path when the executable is an *absolute* path AND close_fds is False;
# otherwise it falls back to fork()+exec. fork() replays libusb's
# pthread_atfork handlers and COW-copies the whole address space while a
# sibling thread is parked inside libusb poll() — a documented, nondeterministic
# heap-corruption vector for multithreaded programs using libusb (random bogus
# TypeErrors + SIGSEGV in PyObject_IsTrue). posix_spawn/vfork skips both, so we
# pin every PipeWire spawn to it and the daemon never fork()s from its

    on SteamOS — every link ASM needs is denied, the channels reach nothing,

    """Recover a usable dump from ``pw-dump`` output that failed a plain
    ``json.loads`` (issue: random ASM audio dropouts, diagnosed on PipeWire
    1.0.5, Aug 2026).

    A single non-monitor ``pw-dump`` invocation is documented as printing one
    JSON array, but in practice it can print **more than one**, concatenated
    back-to-back with no separator, when a registry object is added/removed
    while pw-dump is still enumerating the graph. The extra document observed
    here is a tiny one-element "tombstone" array like ``[{"id": N, "info":
    null}]`` — and it can appear *before or after* the real dump, so the
    real dump is not reliably "the first document".

    ``json.loads`` treats any trailing bytes after the first valid document
    as a hard parse error ("Extra data"), so ``_pw_dump()`` used to return
    ``[]`` on every one of these — an apparently *empty* PipeWire graph. The
    loopback watchdog (``core.py: _loopback_watchdog``) reads an empty dump
    as "every loopback/EQ target is gone" and escalates to recreating
    loopbacks and restarting the filter-chain service — tearing down and
    rebuilding the exact audio path that was actually fine. That churn is
    the mechanism behind ASM's random audio dropouts, not any real failure
    of PipeWire or the headset.

    This walks every concatenated JSON document in the output via
    ``JSONDecoder.raw_decode`` and returns the largest list (by object
    count) — the real dump always has hundreds of entries; a tombstone has
    exactly one. Returns ``None`` if nothing parseable was found at all.

    *node_name* is the ``node.name`` of the filter-chain's own outer node
    (e.g. ``"effect_input.sonar-game-eq"``) — the individual biquad/LADSPA
    nodes declared inside its ``filter.graph`` (``bq0``, ``macro_basses``,
    ``boost``, …) are NOT separate PipeWire objects with their own id; their
    controls are exposed as ``Props`` params on this one outer node, each
    addressed as ``"<internal-name>:<Control>"`` (e.g. ``"bq0:Gain"``,
    ``"macro_basses:Gain"``, ``"boost:Gain"``).

    Verified against a live Sonar EQ node on PipeWire 1.6.7::

        $ pw-cli enum-params <id> Props | grep bq0
              String "bq0:Freq" / "bq0:Q" / "bq0:Gain" ...
        $ pw-cli set-param <id> Props '{ params = [ "bq0:Freq" 31.25 "bq0:Q" 0.707 "bq0:Gain" 6.0 ] }'
        # readback via enum-params confirms every value took effect immediately

    This sidesteps the SIGTERM-during-DSP race that SEGVs filter-chain on
    PipeWire 1.6.7 when a control value change is instead applied by
    regenerating the config and restarting the service (issue #100/#88).

    The whole batch goes in a single ``set-param``, and the node is resolved
    once for it. That matters: a curve edit routinely moves several controls
    at a time (deleting a band shifts every band below it down a rack slot,
    three controls each, doubled on the stereo channels), and a dump plus a
    ``pw-cli`` spawn per control turned a 25 ms apply into a second and a
    half of "pending" — long enough for the next edit to land on top of it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_name:
        ``node.name`` of the filter-chain's capture-side node, resolved to a
        PipeWire object id via a fresh ``pw-dump`` (Correctif — issue #123:
        the lookup goes through ``_pw_dump()``/``_pw_run()``, never a raw
        subprocess spawn).
    controls:
        ``{control_key: value}``, e.g. ``{"bq3:Gain": -2.0, "bq3:Freq": 900.0}``.
        An empty mapping is a no-op and succeeds.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True when *node_name* was found in the graph and ``pw-cli set-param``
        exited 0 (after one permission-repair retry if the first attempt was

        or the call still failed after that retry — the caller must treat

    """Return the node.name of the node currently linked as the input of *playback_name*.

    In other words: given the ``node.name`` of the playback side of a
    ``pw-loopback`` (e.g. ``"Arctis_Game_sink_out"``), return the name of the
    downstream node that PipeWire has actually wired it to
    (e.g. ``"effect_input.sonar-game-eq"`` when correctly linked, or
    ``"alsa_output.usb-SteelSeries_..."`` when WirePlumber has mis-routed it).

    Parameters
    ----------
    playback_name:
        ``node.name`` of the loopback playback node to inspect.
    data:
        Optional pre-fetched ``pw-dump`` payload (list of objects).  When
        *None*, a fresh ``pw-dump`` is executed.

    Returns
    -------
    str | None
        The ``node.name`` of the linked input node, or *None* if the loopback
        is not currently linked to anything, *playback_name* is ambiguous
        (see below), or an error occurred.

    Ambiguity handling (CHA-1, read-only counterpart):
        Resolving *which* node produced a link matters just as much here as
        it does in :func:`ensure_loopback_link` — if two nodes share
        *playback_name*, iterating the dump and returning on the first
        matching Link answers about *whichever one happened to be found
        first*, not about the one the caller (the loopback watchdog, or a
        diagnostics view) actually means. That is silently misleading in
        exactly the way CHA-1 warns about, even though this function never
        touches the graph.

        So *playback_name* is resolved through the same
        :func:`_index_nodes_by_name` / :func:`_resolve_unique_node_id` path
        the write-side siblings use, and an ambiguous name returns *None*
        with a loud ``ERROR`` log — same sentinel as "not linked yet". This
        is deliberately *not* the same as those siblings' "refuse to act"
        behaviour: refusing to link protects a mutation, but a query has
        nothing to protect by refusing — it would only turn a transient,
        self-healing bit of uncertainty into a dead end for whoever reads
        the answer. The existing caller contract already treats *None* as
        "leave it alone, don't act on this tick" (see
        ``core.py``'s ``_loopback_watchdog``), which is exactly the right
        response to "I can't currently tell which node this is" — safer
        than guessing, and it resolves itself the moment the duplicate goes
        away.

        The downstream side (the node the link actually points *at*) needs
        no such treatment: once *playback_name* resolves to one concrete
        node id, the link is looked up by that id, and the reported input
        node is identified by its own id too — a duplicate name on that side
        cannot make this function point at the wrong node, it can only make
        the string it returns collide with another node's name (which is
        already true of node.name in general, and orthogonal to what this
        function is answering).

    """Ensure the ASM-owned capture side of a filter-chain is fed by *source_name*.

    Input-side counterpart of :func:`ensure_loopback_link` (issue #127): the
    Sonar Micro EQ's capture node (``effect_input.sonar-micro-eq``) runs with
    ``node.autoconnect = false`` / ``state.restore-target = false`` (the same
    issue #100 "ASM owns this link" pattern, applied to the input side), so
    WirePlumber never links or moves it. Every filter-chain restart triggered
    by a micro EQ edit recreates this node with nothing linked into it, and
    without an explicit enforcement pass WirePlumber can (and does, per issue
    #127) route it to whatever it considers the current default source — a
    second microphone — instead of the Arctis. This function is what
    (re)establishes and enforces the Arctis → micro-EQ link, channel-matched,
    exactly like ``ensure_loopback_link`` does for playback.

    Teardown scope is intentionally **inverted** compared to
    ``ensure_loopback_link``: *source_name* here is a shared physical device
    (the Arctis microphone) that may legitimately feed other consumers too
    (a voice recorder, OBS, a second capture app, …) — tearing down "stray"
    links found on the *source*'s output ports would silently sever those.
    So only links landing on *capture_name*'s input ports are inspected: any
    such link whose upstream is not *source_name* is a mis-route (e.g. a
    competing mic WirePlumber wired in instead) and is torn down; every other
    link leaving *source_name* toward a different destination is left
    completely untouched.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_name:
        ``node.name`` of the physical microphone source (e.g. the Arctis
        ALSA capture PCM returned by ``sonar_to_pipewire._get_physical_in()``).
    capture_name:
        ``node.name`` of the ASM-owned filter-chain capture node
        (``effect_input.sonar-micro-eq``).
    data:
        Optional pre-fetched ``pw-dump`` payload; a fresh dump is executed
        when *None*. May be reused across a watchdog tick alongside
        ``ensure_loopback_link``/``ensure_spatial_eq_links``.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True when every source channel that also exists on the capture node
        is linked to it. False when either node is absent from the graph
        (mic unplugged, filter-chain not up yet) or no channel could be
        matched, so the caller can retry later.
