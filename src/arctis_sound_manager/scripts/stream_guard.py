"""Keep unwanted audio out of Discord's screen share, event-driven.

Discord creates its own ``discord_capture`` node when a screen share starts and
links every playback stream into it — the whole system's audio goes out to the
call. It relinks continuously, so a one-shot ``pw-link -d`` does not hold; the
obvious workaround is a polling loop, but any poll interval is also the window
during which private audio is already on the wire.

This daemon instead uses ``pw-mon`` as a wake signal: PipeWire announces graph
changes as they happen, so a link Discord has just created is destroyed within
the debounce interval (~0.1 s) rather than at the next tick of a timer. After
the initial object enumeration ``pw-mon`` is silent on an idle graph, so the
guard costs nothing while nothing is happening.

Which sources are allowed is decided by :mod:`arctis_sound_manager.stream_guard`
from the Arctis channel each stream sits on — see that module for the rule.
