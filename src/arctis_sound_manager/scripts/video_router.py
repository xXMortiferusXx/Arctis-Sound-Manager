    graph — e.g. a soundboard feeding its mic-injection stream into a

    stream doesn't just change where it is heard, it breaks the other app's

    behavior (issue #20). Pins to ASM's own sinks follow normal routing.

    recognised and is adopted as before. Resolving those would mean mapping
    PipeWire serials to nodes (the PulseAudio sink index is a different

# ── Capture-direction streams (issue #225) ────────────────────────────────
# Until now the router only ever looked at sink-inputs, so nothing in ASM had
# any visibility over a capture stream. A recorder such as Steam's Game
# Recording therefore landed wherever WirePlumber's own fallback put it —
# typically a monitor carrying none of the game audio, which is why the clips
# came back with a silent track, or with nothing but whatever happened to be
# on Media (Steam's own clip-saved chime).
#
# One rule makes this pass safe: only ever move a stream that is ALREADY
# reading a monitor. A stream reading a real capture device is somebody's
# microphone, and pointing it at a monitor would replace their voice with the
# game audio. That is not hypothetical here — it is the exact failure pinned
# by tests/test_mic_never_fed_by_an_output.py, where a sink monitor ended up
# feeding the mic chain and a browser tab went out over Discord as if the user
# were speaking it. That file notes the failure is silent to whoever causes
# it. Restricting this pass to monitor -> monitor means the microphone cannot
# be caught by it even if an override names one.

    # them onto the chosen device. Two things were wrong with it. The first is
    # that it fought the block above in the same tick: the override says "Chrome
    # belongs on Arctis_Media", this said "anything on Arctis_Media belongs on
    # the earbuds", and each undid the other on every pass — the log showed the
    # pair one second apart, and the device menu appeared to do nothing at all.
    #
    # The second is that winning was no better than losing. Dragging a stream
    # off Arctis_Media takes it out of that channel entirely, past the Sonar EQ
    # and the HeSuVi stage, which is the whole reason the channel exists.
    #
    # Sending a channel somewhere means moving the *channel's* last link, not
    # its applications: `sonar_to_pipewire.ensure_physical_output_links` points
    # each channel's HeSuVi output at `channel_destination(channel)`, and Media
    # has its own HeSuVi instance so it can differ from Game. That is where this
    # belongs and where it already works.
    #
    # #177 landed on develop while this branch was open and reached for the
    # other half of the same problem: it made the override pass resolve through
    # the channel-output mapping too, so the two passes agree instead of
    # fighting. That does stop the oscillation — but both passes then agree on
    # dragging the stream off its channel, which is the second problem above.
    # The link-level fix below covers the oscillation as well, so the resolve
    # step #177 added has nothing left to do here.
