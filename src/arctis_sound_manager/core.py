    async def _loopback_watchdog(self) -> None:
        """Periodically check for dead or mislinked loopback processes.

        Runs as an asyncio ``Task`` alongside ``core_loop``.  Every 5 seconds,
        if a device is currently connected (``device_state.is_device_set()``),
        performs three checks in order:

        0. **Socket change detection** — compares the current PipeWire socket
           path to the one seen on the previous tick.  If it differs (e.g.
           Gamescope / Steam Game Mode session switch under Distrobox), all
           loopbacks are recreated immediately and the rest of the tick is
           skipped so they have one full cycle to bind to the new socket.
        1. **Dead-process pass** — calls :meth:`LoopbackManager.restart_dead`
           to revive any crashed ``pw-loopback`` processes.
        2. **Link-enforcement pass** — for every loopback that was *not* just
           restarted and is still running, calls
           :func:`~arctis_sound_manager.pw_utils.ensure_loopback_link` to make
           sure the playback node is linked, channel-for-channel, to its EQ
           target.  Because the loopbacks run with ``node.autoconnect=false``
           (issue #100), WirePlumber never links or moves them: ASM owns the
           links.  A loopback can therefore only be *correctly linked* or
           *not-yet-linked* — never "mislinked to a physical DAC" — so no
           competing output device (a second USB DAC, the default sink, …) can
           ever steal it, and there is no WirePlumber tug-of-war to fight.  When
           the link cannot be established the loopback is treated as an orphan:
           it is given ``_ORPHAN_GRACE_TICKS`` consecutive failing ticks (15 s at
           the default interval) before action, because a one-tick failure is a
           normal transient (e.g. the surround chain rebuilding when Spatial
           Audio toggles).  After the grace period, if the target EQ node is
           absent the filter-chain is assumed dead and
           :func:`~arctis_sound_manager.sonar_to_pipewire.ensure_filter_chain_healthy`
           is called instead of a pointless recreate; otherwise the loopback is
           recreated.

        **Anti-flapping guard** — a recreate is still a heavyweight action, so
        the watchdog tracks recent interventions per channel and applies an
        exponential-backoff cooldown when a channel is recreated too often.
        During cooldown the channel is skipped entirely (no restart, no
        recreate).  A muted-but-stable loopback is less disruptive than constant
        cuts.

        The coroutine exits cleanly when ``self._stopping`` is set (by
        :meth:`stop`) or when the task is cancelled (by the daemon shutdown
        handler).  Errors are always caught and logged — this coroutine must
        never crash the daemon.

        All the link passes in a watchdog tick share the single ``pw-dump``
        taken at the top of it. Ports move underneath that snapshot —
        WirePlumber churn, an ALSA reconfiguration — and ids resolved from it
        then point at nothing, which is what produces the observed
        ``pw-link … failed``, ``(4/8 channels linked)`` and
        ``no matchable ports … in=[]`` bursts. Rather than write off the whole
        tick and wait five seconds, re-dump **once** and retry; the extra
        subprocess is only ever paid when something actually failed.

        Unlike the loopback→EQ pass, these hops had no escalation whatsoever:
        they logged and retried forever. After *max_fail_ticks* consecutive
        failed ticks this calls ``ensure_filter_chain_healthy()`` once, then
        clears the counter so escalation cannot loop.

        *skip_targets* (#180), only forwarded to *fn* when given — not every
        hop's function accepts it (``ensure_micro_capture_link`` does not) —
        as a keyword argument via ``functools.partial``, since
        ``loop.run_in_executor`` only accepts positional args. A hop whose
        target was cut on purpose during an idle period is thus excluded from

        Devices with two ALSA PCMs (e.g. Arctis 7 Pro Audio firmware) expose
        pro-output-0 (mono, chat/sidetone) and pro-output-1 (stereo, game).
        `get_arctis_sinks_classified()` separates them; single-output devices
        return the same sink for both roles.

        Returns (game_sink_name, chat_sink_name, source_name) — any can be None.

        `attempts` is a budget for finding a **sink**, not a source: the loop
        returns on the first pass where a sink matches, and reports whatever the
        source lookup happened to yield on that same pass. When the sink is
        there immediately, which is the usual case, the microphone gets exactly
        one look and None is a perfectly ordinary answer for it. Raising
        `attempts` does not widen anything for the mic.

        That is deliberate rather than an oversight: audio routing should not
        wait on a capture node, and the mic is picked up afterwards by
        `_rediscover_physical_input_if_missing()` on the watchdog tick, which
        also covers the mic appearing minutes later (#206). Callers must treat a
        None source as "not known yet", never as "this device has no mic".
