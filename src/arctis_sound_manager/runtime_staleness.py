"""Detect that the package was upgraded underneath a running process.

A package manager replaces files on disk; it does not touch processes. Python
loaded its modules at startup and keeps executing them, so after `pacman -Syu`,
`dnf upgrade` or `apt upgrade`, the GUI and the daemon go on running the version
they started with — usually until the next reboot.

That is worse than it sounds. Someone upgrades *because* of a fix, sees the bug
still there, and reports it against a version number they are not running. The
bug report says 1.2.14; the code answering the report is 1.2.12.

Package scriptlets restart the user services (see
``scripts/restart-user-services.sh``), but the GUI is commonly started by the
desktop's autostart rather than systemd, and killing someone's open window from
inside a package transaction would be rude. So the GUI checks for itself and
offers.
