"""The opt-in Aux channel, and making room for it (#209).

Someone using Media for video wants their music somewhere else, with its own
EQ. The mixer already holds four cards — Game, Chat, Media and Output — so Aux
makes a fifth, and five cards at the old fixed 260 px minimum need a window
around 1840 px. That is wider than a 1366 px laptop screen, and the row has no
scroll area to fall back on: Qt would push the window off the edge of the
display rather than let a card shrink.

So the channel is off unless asked for, and the cards' minimum width depends on
how many are on screen.
