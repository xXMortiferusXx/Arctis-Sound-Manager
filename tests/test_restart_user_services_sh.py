"""scripts/restart-user-services.sh must restart the daemon on dinit too.

Wired into debian/postinst, aur/*.install and the RPM %post, this script used
to hardcode `systemctl --user try-restart ...` with no fallback: on a dinit
box (Artix, Arch+dinit) the upgrade scriptlet ran, found no systemd unit to
touch, and did nothing — the daemon kept executing the pre-upgrade code
indefinitely, exactly the inversion runtime_staleness.py's docstring exists to
prevent.

These tests run the real script (not a mock of it) against a fake PATH so no
real systemctl/dinitctl/runuser ever executes and nothing on this developer's
own live session is touched — only the stub binaries below are, and they log
their own invocations instead of doing anything.
