# Arctis Sound Manager: USB access diagnostic
#
# Read-only. Removes nothing, installs nothing, changes no setting. It answers
# one question: why can ASM not open the headset on this machine?
#
# Run it:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loteran/Arctis-Sound-Manager/main/scripts/diagnose-usb-access.sh | bash
#
# It writes a report to ~/asm-usb-access.txt and prints it. Attach that file to
# the issue or discussion you are replying to.
#
# Self-contained on purpose: no BASH_SOURCE, no prompts, nothing read from
# stdin. stdin is the script itself when this is piped into bash, which is
# exactly what broke the uninstaller in discussion #190.
set -uo pipefail   # no -e: a probe that fails is a result, not a reason to stop
