# Restart ASM's user services after a package upgrade.
#
# Why this exists: a package manager replaces files on disk, it does not touch
# running processes. Python has already loaded the old modules into memory, so
# asm-daemon keeps executing the previous version until something restarts it —
# for most people, until their next reboot. Someone who upgrades *for* a fix
# then finds the bug still there, and reports it against a version they are not
# running.
#
# Called from the post-upgrade scriptlet of every packaging (pacman .install,
# RPM %post, deb postinst), which run as root while user sessions are live.
#
# Deliberately try-restart, not restart: it only touches services that are
# already running. Someone who stopped ASM on purpose does not get it started
# again by installing an update.
#
# Handles both init systems ASM supports for the user session (systemd and
# dinit — see service_control.py, the Python single source of truth for this
# mapping; this script mirrors it by hand because packaging scriptlets run
# before/outside any Python environment can be assumed usable). A box with
# neither has nothing here to restart into: the GUI's own upgrade check
# (runtime_staleness.py) still offers a restart on next launch.

# idea what the user is doing, and killing their tray app from it meant the
# old GUI's exit path ran mid-upgrade — which, before 1.4.27, bounced the
# whole audio server and took plasmashell down with it. The GUI notices the
# upgrade itself (runtime_staleness.py) and offers the restart in its own
