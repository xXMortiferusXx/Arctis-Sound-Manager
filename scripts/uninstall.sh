# Arctis Sound Manager — uninstaller
#
# Detects every existing install (distro package, pipx, distrobox, and a
# `pip install --user` copy in ~/.local) and lets the user pick which one(s)
# to remove. Designed for the common case "I want to drop
# the system package and switch to pipx" (or vice-versa) without nuking the
# install I want to keep.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh                # interactive
#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh --all          # remove every detected install
#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh --pipx         # remove only the pipx install
#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh --pkg          # remove only the distro package
#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh --pip-user     # remove only the ~/.local pip copy
#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh --purge        # also wipe ~/.config/arctis_manager,
#                                            # PipeWire configs and udev rules
#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh --yes          # skip confirmations
#
# Run remote (no clone needed):
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loteran/Arctis-Sound-Manager/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | bash
set -euo pipefail

# `curl … | bash` leaves BASH_SOURCE unset: bash reads the script from stdin,
# so there is no file to take a directory from. Under `set -u` that alone
# aborts the script, and since bash 5.3 the `cd ""` that follows fails too,
# which is how the documented one-liner died on this very line, before
# printing anything, on every distro shipping a current bash.
# An empty SCRIPT_DIR is the honest answer: every use of it below already
# checks that the file it wants is actually there, and falls back to curl.
